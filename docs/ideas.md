# Innovative Idea
Our idea: A centralized hub to find study groups and study partners.
The idea is to have list of all the classes taught at UMass and have students the ability to create and join study 
groups. Group can list their meeting time, date and location. Students can also invite members into the group. 
This hub also acts like a resource center where we can store resources for a class.
Each group will have a chat room to discuss.
